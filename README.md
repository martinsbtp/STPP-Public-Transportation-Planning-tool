### Contact and Report a Bug

<img src="images/contact.png" width="300" />

We need to evaluate the application performance. Feel free to submit a bug. We appreciate the effort.
The contact form uses gmail to send messages. No name or email is required to get in touch. Just send subject and message.

&nbsp;

### Limitations
---
The Google Maps API needs to be implemented to provide more search options.

Google Maps does not include bus/subway integration results.

A database search must include all line routes available in the system. We need to integrate the STPP application with the State of Pernmabuco cloud system.

The application works with sensitive data sent by the ombudsman's servers. These data are not available for investigation. On the other hand, all legislation can be consulted during beta tests.
